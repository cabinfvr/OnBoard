# Brycen's MP3 Player

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
i designed a simple mp3 player because i have wanted to do this for while. i just want it to continiously shuffle songs on an sd card (diff cards for diff playlists) because spotify sucks
i will write custom software to read the sd card shuffle it and output to the aux jack

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
jlcpcb says it will cost $9.00 USD

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
My design process was inspired by apple and nothing i guess. i really like the design aspects of both. some challenges i faced was that why was the
sd card reader so big in the pcb software. i also couldn't figure out what "switch" meant when operating on the battery because 
when i looked up switch pcb it was just nintendo switches.
